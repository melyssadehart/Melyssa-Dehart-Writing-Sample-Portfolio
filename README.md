## Writing Samples

| **Document** | **Description** |
| ------------- | ------------------ |
| Computer-Based Tutorials |
| [Computer-Based Tutorial Mockup (Microsoft PowerPoint)](https://github.com/melyssadehart/Melyssa-Dehart-Writing-Sample-Portfolio/blob/532530226e1164f8c8018a3abed7499d2b3ba068/Computer-Based%20Tutorials/MelyssaDehart_computerbasedtutorialmockup_MicrosoftPowerPoint.pdf) | Mockup created in Microsoft PowerPoint as part of a proposed change to an existing computer-based tutorial (CBT). The original CBT combined all workflow steps in one module, resulting in a lengthy experience for the user. My proposal subdivided the course into smaller, individual modules for each workflow step that allowed the user to learn at their own pace and better digest and retain the information. If approved, the module would have been created in Articulate 360 to provide a more interactive experience for the user.|
